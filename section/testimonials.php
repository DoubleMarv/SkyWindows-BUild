								<p>Had triple glazing fitted by Sky Windows about 6 months ago, not one problem since with any of the 14 windows + 1 door. Good company to deal with but what made them exceptional were the fitters. Can’t remember their names but they were a pleasure to have in the house, absolutely gifted tradesmen and were really intent on doing a good job.</p>

								<p>Fabulous!!! So happy that I went with Sky Windows for the windows and doors in my new house. Mary in the office was a pleasure to deal with, and so helpful with arranging fitting times etc. After being badly burned by another company I was a bit nervous about the whole process again, but it all went smoothly and stress free. Id highly recommend Sky Windows to anyone who wants quality service and products.</p>

								<p>I live in an apartment with a lot of street noise due to a very busy junction. Recently I went on the market to see how I could mitigate this, but most window fitting companies recommended me triple glazing (which really doesn't solve the issue with sound, only secondary glazing solves it). Sky Windows was the only company that recommended secondary glazing to solve the noise problem. I decided to go with them to replace 3 old windows with triple glazing and add secondary glazing to the problematic window in my room. I was very happy with the result. The whole process was very smooth. We agreed a delivery time that was upheld and the crew was very professional (when fitting the windows, they covered all my things with blankets and vacuumed everything in the end).</p>
